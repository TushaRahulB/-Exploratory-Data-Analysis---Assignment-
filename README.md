# Market Sales Analysis – Tiger Analytics Assignment

## Project Overview

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** assignment completed for **Tiger Analytics** as part of an internship evaluation. The dataset contains monthly sales and operational data for over **690 retail stores** across the U.S. from **2015 to 2020**.

Each store is categorized under super divisions such as **GIRLS, BOYS, KIDS**, and **ACCESSORIES**, and includes attributes like:

- Store type (Outlet, Full-line, etc.)
- Climate zone
- Total square footage
- Opening and closing dates
- Remodeling status

---

## Objective

The goal of the analysis is to uncover **actionable business insights** that help a major U.S. apparel retailer make informed strategic decisions—such as:

- Identifying the most profitable store segments
- Evaluating top-performing regions for expansion
- Understanding seasonality in sales trends
- Analyzing store closures and remodeling patterns

---
