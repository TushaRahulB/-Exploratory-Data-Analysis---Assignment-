Market Sales Analysis â€“ Tiger Analytics Assignment

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) assignment completed for Tiger Analytics as part of an internship evaluation. The dataset consists of monthly sales and operational data for over 690 retail stores in the U.S. from 2015 to 2020. Each store is categorized by divisions (like GIRLS, BOYS, KIDS, etc.), and additional attributes such as store type, climate zone, square footage, opening/closing dates, and remodeling status are included.

The objective of the analysis is to uncover key business insights that can guide the client (a major U.S. apparel retailer) in making strategic decisionsâ€”such as identifying profitable store segments, ideal locations for expansion, seasonal trends in sales, and patterns behind store closures or remodels.

The project uses Python and the Streamlit library to create an interactive web-based dashboard. Each business question is presented with:

A clear explanation

A visual/chart/table output

An expandable code block for transparency

Key Questions Answered:
What is the total sales trend year-over-year?

Which super division generates the most revenue?

How many stores were opened in 1991 or remodeled later?

Is there a correlation between sales and store size?

Which states show the highest sales potential?

What is the ideal month to open a new store?

Do outlet types influence store closure rates?

Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Streamlit for dashboard UI

OpenPyXL for Excel file handling

The final output is a client-ready interactive app designed to help decision-makers explore data visually without writing code. It demonstrates the application of real-world EDA practices to business problems.
